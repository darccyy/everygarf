# EveryGarf

A Rust program to download every Garfield comic to date.

# TODO

- download todays date (as opposed to yesterdays)
    - must check for time, lest same image is downloaded with different name (different apparent date)
    - check if current time is after a certain time (utc)
    - if yes: do todays as well
    - if no: only do up to yesterday

- Add stilo colours

- Create folder if not exist?
- Ignore 'clean' if folder not exist?
